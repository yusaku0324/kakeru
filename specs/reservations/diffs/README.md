# Reservations diff specs

Add per-issue diffs here using the same format as matching:

1. Current behavior (as of main)
2. Change in this issue (diff)
3. Non-goals
4. Links (Issue: #<number> with URL, plus implementing PRs)

When a reservations-related issue/PR is opened, create or update a file `specs/reservations/diffs/<issue-number>-<short-kebab-slug>.md` following this structure and link it from the issue/PR description.
