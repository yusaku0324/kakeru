# Auth diff specs

Add per-issue diffs here using the standard format:

1. Current behavior (as of main)
2. Change in this issue
3. Non-goals
4. Links (Issue: #<number> with URL, plus implementing PRs)

Filename rule: `specs/auth/diffs/<issue-number>-<short-kebab-slug>.md` (e.g., `85-magic-link-auth.md`, `88-split-admin-site-auth.md`, `136-auth-clean-architecture.md`).

When an auth-related issue/PR is opened, create or update the corresponding diff spec and link it from the issue/PR description.
